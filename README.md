📈 Data Analysis Project (Python + Power BI)

This project combines Python for data preprocessing and Power BI for visualization to transform a raw automobile industry sales dataset into an interactive dashboard that supports customer analysis, product performance review, and regional sales strategy.

🎯 Project Aim

To clean, analyze, and visualize sales data in order to uncover actionable insights on customer demographics, product profitability, and geographic trends — enabling stakeholders to make informed, data-driven decisions.

🧰 Tools Used

Python: Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, OpenPyXL

Power BI: KPI Cards, Charts, Slicers, DAX Measures

Google Colab: Data analysis environment

Excel / CSV: For data export and import into Power BI

👥 Key Stakeholders

Sales Managers – Align strategies with profitable customer and region segments

Marketing Team – Target campaigns based on demographic and behavioral insights

Product Managers – Optimize pricing and assess product-level performance

Finance Team – Forecast using accurate cost, profit, and revenue analysis

Regional Managers – Plan based on location-specific performance

Executive Leadership – Use KPIs and trends for strategic growth planning

🧪 Python (Colab) – Data Preparation & Exploration

Performed comprehensive data preparation and feature engineering, including:

Data Exploration: Reviewed structure and key statistics (e.g., Customer_Age, Unit_Cost, Revenue)

Numerical & Categorical Analysis: Box plots, histograms, density plots, and bar/pie charts

Correlation Analysis: Heatmaps and scatter plots showing relationships between revenue, profit, and age

Feature Engineering:

Revenue_per_Age: Efficiency by customer age

Calculated_Cost: Order Quantity × Unit Cost

Calculated_Revenue: Cost + Profit

Adjustments:

3% tax added to Unit_Price

10% revenue increase for France to simulate regional strategy

Data Export: Saved as .csv and .xlsx for Power BI

Using the modified dataset, an interactive Power BI dashboard was created with:

📌 Customer Insights

Revenue by Age_Group and Gender

KPI Cards: Total Revenue, Profit, Avg. Order Quantity

Identified Adults (35–64) as the most profitable segment

📌 Product Insights

Sub-category performance by profit

Scatter plot: Unit_Cost vs Profit

Profit margin analysis using DAX measures

📌 Regional Insights

Revenue by Country and State

Slicers: Age_Group, Product, Country, Year

Simulated growth scenario in France
